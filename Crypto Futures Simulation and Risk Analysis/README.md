# Crypto Futures Simulation & Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project studies leveraged futures trading in cryptocurrencies and systematically evaluates the associated risks for both customers and exchanges. We focus on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB), simulating different leverage levels and stop-loss strategies to understand their effects on equity and risk.

## What We Did
1. **Leveraged Futures Simulation**  
   - Modeled daily equity changes for leveraged positions across multiple cryptocurrencies.  
   - Tested different leverage levels (2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, 20x).  
   - Compared scenarios with and without stop-loss to see how customer protection impacts outcomes.

2. **Stop-Loss Implementation & Analysis**  
   - Implemented stop-loss rules that automatically close positions when losses exceed a threshold.  
   - Tracked both customer equity at stop-loss and the exchange’s profit from liquidation fees.  
   - Quantified how stop-loss affects maximum customer loss and exchange profitability.

3. **Multi-Customer & Multi-Coin Simulation**  
   - Simulated diversified portfolios for multiple customers to reflect realistic trading behavior.  
   - Modeled allocation across BTC, ETH, and BNB with random initial equity and leverage.

4. **Risk Metrics & Quantitative Analysis**  
   - Calculated maximum drawdown, annualized volatility, and Sharpe ratio for each scenario.  
   - Compared how leverage and stop-loss strategies impact risk and returns.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted customer equity over time, exchange profit vs leverage, and maximum losses.  
   - Clearly highlighted the effect of stop-loss and leverage on both customers and the exchange.

## Key Results
- **Exchange Profit**: Generally increases with leverage; stop-loss can significantly boost profits in mid-leverage scenarios.  
- **Customer Protection**: Stop-loss effectively limits maximum loss, especially at high leverage.  
- **Risk Trends**: Without stop-loss, high leverage leads to extreme drawdowns. With stop-loss, drawdowns are controlled, though exchange profits may slightly increase due to liquidation fees.  
- **Diversification**: Multi-coin, multi-customer simulations show smoother equity curves and reduced extreme losses compared to single-coin, single-customer scenarios.
